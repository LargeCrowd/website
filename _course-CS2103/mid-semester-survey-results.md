Good to see that most of you prefer the current mode.<br>
One advantage of live lectures (F2F or online) is that
 you can ask questions immediately if something is unclear.<br>
==On-the-spot Q&A doesn't scale up to very large classes==, unfortunately --
 even if your question is relevant to half the class, it becomes a disruption to the remaining
 hundreds of students, especially so for a course like ours
 in which the students' learning speed can vary a lot.<br>
Hence, our live lectures are limited to briefings only, while most content are delivered as text and
 pre-recorded lectures which students can consume at their own pace.<br>
 Nevertheless, ==you can attend lectures F2F if you wish==, as we have now moved to hybrid mode lectures, 
 although we are unlikely to support mid-lecture interactions due to the reason given above.
 While the lecturer can still answer some questions at the end of the lecture, the rest needs to be asynchronous
 e.g., via email or the forum.<br>
 On the positive side, we follow multiple topic threads every week, which means you can continue learning other topic
 threads while waiting for an answer you raised asynchronously. Also, the topics are not that deep/complex
 -- the chance of getting stuck is lower.<br>
 So, I hope you guys are able to manage even if we don't do live lectures covering all content.<br>

==Unlike most courses that use lectures as the _primary_ mechanism for delivering course content, our lecture briefings
 serve as a _complementary_ 'top up'==, covering additional examples, motivations behind the topics, commentary on
 how to shape your attitudes related to the subject, anecdotes, etc.
Hence, you can skip lecture briefings (or simply speed-watch the recording later) if you 
 are short of time or if you think they are not useful to you.
 Even the in-lecture quiz questions are 'optional' in the sense they are unlikely to make a
 difference in your final participation marks.<br>
 :fas-exclamation: Note: Totally ignoring the lecture briefings will exclude you from future CS2103/T tutor positions
 though, as I do not want to employ as a tutor someone who hasn't received the _full view_ of the course
 (I often talk about the goals/rationales of the course during lecture briefings
 -- not examinable but important nevertheless, especially for a future tutor).

Although a slight majority prefers online tutorials, we have now moved to F2F mode, to comply with NUS
policy. Although online tutorials seem like a more 'efficient' mode (e.g., no need for travel), I expect physically
meeting with team members often will have some intangible benefits for you in the long run.<br>
We still use Zoom out of necessity (e.g., to share slides, to collect answers), and to get the best of
 both modes (e.g., to have a recording of the tutorial).

Good to see that tutorials are mostly well-received.<br>
Admittedly, our tutorials can feel slow, less efficient, or less active. For students who otherwise
  prepare well for the tutorials and actively take part in tutorial discussions, this is indeed the case.
  I hope you still bear with us because ==the tutorial structure (like many other things in this course)
  is intended to _raise the lower bar of the whole class_, which is important when there is a major team project
  (to reduce the skill gap between team members)==. 
  * **We start with a 10-minute warm up** to give everyone at least a chance to familiarize with the tutorial tasks
    even if they haven't had time to look at them earlier (we don't want them to be left out entirely).
  * **By requiring _everyone_ to respond via private messages**, we aim to get everyone to _think_ about the topic
    at hand and attempt to answer without being biased by others’ answers.
    As I mentioned in a previous lecture, pedagogy research has shown that this act of thinking/attempting
    before receiving the correct answer increases the effectiveness of learning,
    even if you get the answer wrong at first.<br>
    That said, we do want to have some verbal discussions to happen too. That's why we ask you to do the follow up
    discussions verbally.
  * **We monitor tutorial participation** because tutorials are used for ensuring that you all have achieved the desired
    learning targets for the week. If not, slower students tend to neglect the theory part 
    (in a misguided attempt to save time) and try to brute-force the project work, which wastes even more time,
    and also exacerbates the skill-gap problems in their teams.
  * So, while the number of questions we go through in each tutorial is fewer and the questions are simpler,
    _getting everyone to answer almost every question on the spot_ (this is different from answering a quiz _at your own
    convenience_, which we already do anyway) has ==a higher total learning gain for the entire class==.<br>
    So, if you are one of the
    stronger students getting less out of our tutorials than you are used to get from other courses, I hope
    you'll be generous and take a 'hit' here to allow your classmates to level up. You might even benefit yourself
    from their levelled-up contributions when you work with them in the team project.

The feedback for the course website is generally positive but there are still _some_ areas to improve further.
  Thanks for your feedback on those. We will continue to try and improve the website whenever we can.<br>
  In the meantime, I thank you for your patience with the website -- it's not easy to disseminate that much
  of information in a way that fits everyone's expectations %%(e.g., some prefer content to be more 'visual'
  while others prefer minimalistic presentation)%%,
  and we realize that ==it is not easy for you to consume that much of information== either.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


The most common concern about this course is the workload.
  I’m afraid it is not going to get any lower in the second half :-(.
  Some suggestions:
  * If you struggled with the iP workload, don’t be too ambitious with the tP.
    In particular, choose the ‘evolve’ option rather than ‘morph’ option (it’s still not too late to change).
    If you choose the ‘morph’ option, don’t plan to morph it too far away from AB3.<br>
    Reminder: there are no marks allocated for marking the product interesting, unique, cool, etc.<br>
    Also, keep in mind that it is the quality that will count more than the quantity. 
    In most cases the quantity is graded on an S/U basis (refer to the tP briefing that we did just before
    the recess break for more info).
    Aim to do less but do it really well.
  * If you don't have time to study all topics, use the 
    [topic levels system](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/admin/courseExpectations.html#topic-levels:~:text=things%20to%20do.-,Topic%20Levels,-We%20use%20a)
    to figure out which topics are higher priority.
  * That said, we know the workload concern is real, and we firmly believe that no course should take more than
    its fair share of students' time. On the other hand, this course aims to teach you SE skills that take a lot
    of practice (hence the high workload).<br>
    We've managed to reduce the workload of this course quite bit over the past semesters, and we'll continue to
    do so when we find ways to do that without compromising our learning outcomes.

The pace itself seems to be less of a problem compared to the workload.<br>
Don't worry if you feel like the course is moving too fast; thanks to the iterative approach we use for covering topics,
 you'll get multiple chances to solidify your familiarity of a topic/tool.

<markdown>I think testing the iP and potentially tP across different operating systems could be done better instead of assuming and relying on teammates to have a mix of macOS/Windows/Linux. I faced a problem where I could open my .jar on MacOS but my friend couldn't do so on Windows and there was a lot of back and forth as it was basically a trial and error process with me trying some changes and building and sending over the .jar each time.

Like how in other courses if you were to write code and the code runs against a grading script, the specifications (programming language version, OS) as usually the same as the configurations on the nus stu servers so you can log in and test by yourself. Perhaps there could be a Github Action step that this course provides to help with the testing (even if its just testing if the jar file can be opened across different OSes).</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Java is platform independent, which means there is no need to do extensive testing on each platform. However, some smoke testing on different platforms is still essential. We hope you'll use it as an opprtunity to collaborate with other classmates i.e., by posting in the forum to get help from others to smoke test your JAR on different OS'es. In the tP, CI is run on all three OS'es (on GitHub Actions), which helps too. 

But if you need fast turnaround, installing virtual machines in your computer is the best bet.</markdown>

<markdown>The twinned mod 2101 does not take into account the original workload of 2103T and frontloads 2 presentations around the same week the iP ramps up - while the deadlines are not strict for iP and the 2 presentations are not actually graded, they set you back a lot for not completing on time and stresses a lot of us out.

Progress tracker feature is very helpful (i.e. iP progress, participation). Website is also very easy to use and has excellent UI. Prof Damith is very organised and really cares about all students and lecture and tutorial qualities. Excellent course!</markdown>

<markdown>maybe share a sample of IP weekly of what an expected product is like or vet and pick some projects that are considered on track/ up to expectations. Without assistance from TAs, it can be difficult to judge how much effort to put in to prevent over-doing and whether we are on the right track as proposed by the course outline. I think it is good that students are free to engineer a product to call their own, but perhaps providing some sort of possible user story or purpose can be useful, as while coding the chat bot, i feel like simply following the weekly increments but lack the motivation to build something that i really want to build. It feels like a random project to just follow and i then felt less motivated to go the extra mile, but just follow the increments.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Yup, that can be useful. At the same time, we also don't want to 'officially' set such a bar (or give the impression of a 'model solution'), as we want to keep things open-ended.

Yes, it may be hard to find motivation when you are following the given increments. We do leave the room open for you to go beyond the given requirements but of course that will take more time and effort too, which you might not have.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Yes, this is indeed one direction we've been looking at for a while now. What's holding us back on this is the worry that those totally new to Git etc and not also strong programmers will get overwhelmed too soon if we frontload the course too much. So, we've been using the rate at which students progress through the work to decide how much workload to set. Currently, about 50% of students keep up with the workload on time, and another 35% reach targets within one week of the deadline, while the remaining 15% need more time to catch up -- which we think is a reasonable rate of progress for a core course. But yes, some in the first 50% might feel like the project is moving too slowly, especially at the start.</markdown>

<markdown>I think it is quite myopic to generalise the pace as "too fast" or "too slow". Moreover, it is also important to bring to attention why the workload of this course seems to be high / pace may seem to be fast.

 

I think it is absolutely essential to cover content during lecture (else, it will just be additional workload with no reward since we need to watch the lecture, self study the mountain of weekly content to answer the lecture quiz). Honestly, I also think most students would be ok if lecture do not cover content provided that lecture time is completely cancelled and we self-study the content (which is what we do now, anyways).

 

Next, why I think that it is myopic to generalise the pace is because we are being told to implement things such as OOP (we have already done that in 2030). Rather, it might be more useful to give us code that is ALREADY written in OOP format and ask us to implement new features and learn new SWE knowledge(gradle, JUnit, assert, etc...). Because we have to implement OOP, we have less time to learn things we are unfamiliar with and that is precisely why we are stretched with time. e.g. by giving us a duke that already works, we can spend 2 weeks learning about unfamiliar features of SWE rather than spending 1 week to create a duke that works and another to learn unfamiliar features of SWE.

 

(also, I do think that some things given to us as self-study materials may not be completely applicable in the real world SWE. I think as a SWE, our basic job scope includes creating features that work rather than learn about surveying, requirements... also... wouldn't learning React be more efficient? what about creating our own APIs so we can link our frontend to our backend? what about deployment of projects?)</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Thanks for taking time to write detailed feedback.



* You are right the lecture goes on top of the self-learning students need to do, adding to the workload. This is why we make it a briefing instead, make it shorter, and also make it **not compulsory**. It provides additional value that is not essential but available to those who find it useful. Even the in-lecture quiz is counted for bonus marks only (which doesn't usually make a difference anyway). This way, we hope you can go through the content at your own pace using your preferred medium (i.e., text or video) while also getting additional value (if you have room for it) from weekly briefings.

* Fair point about making iP brownfield as well. In fact, this is what we used to do: i.e., take students through AB1, AB2, AB3, AB4, progressively exposing students to code bases of varying degree of OOP and other advanced features. But after a rew rounds of that we found it works well for strong students, it doesn't work well for the rest. So, we introduced the iP as a greenfield project so that students who didn't do well in CS2030/S or did it much earlier has a chance to build up their coding/OOP muscle before they start working in a brownfield project. Also, there is the argument that a student who already learned OOP/Java will not be slowed down that much by the very simple iP feaures scheduled for the first two weeks. 

* The topic of 'requirements' is considered an important part of SE, and an essential part of the software life cycle. You are right that not all SWEs need to work on dealing with user requirements but most will need to understand and communicate about requirements nevertheless, as a product that doesn't meet user requirements properly will fail, no matter how good the code is.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Yes, some of the quizzes have a high number of questions. They are mostly T/F questions though. We can reduce the question count by combining them into a smaller number of MCQ (with 4-5 options) but that will make each question harder to answer correctly. Splitting into multiple quizzes doesn't actually help either. BTW, you don't need to answer the full quiz in one  sitting (Canvas saves the answers automatically, and submits them at the deadline automatically). Try to answer questions in parallel to reading the topics so that it doesn't feel like such a chore.</markdown>

<markdown>Some problems faced:

No problems yet, just that it was a bit tedious going through the JavaFX links. Would have been better if we had pre-recorded videos so we can follow along and learn how the code works, rather than copy-paste the lines from the provided links.

Also would be better if all tutorial sessions are F2F (don't prefer online lessons considering it's a group based tutorial).

Lastly, it would be better if the lectures go over difficult topics (since current lecture is very brief).

 

Some good things:

Really amazing how every week feedback is given, and how prof responds on the forum. The scripts written are really good and impressive!

 

Overall, I really enjoyed building Duke and learning SWE fundamentals, and it has been one of the best CS courses I have taken so far.

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>* Good suggestion about JavaFX tutorial. It is one of the things we want to improve in the future.

* Glad to hear you like F2F tutorials. We have now moved to F2F tutorials. Our tutorials use a few tools toghether (Zoom, MSTeams), so, we need to get there in 2-3 steps, to allow time for tutors and students to get used to each.

* Hopefully, pre-recorded lectures makes up for not going through topics during the weekly briefing.

* Thanks for the kind words about the course. Glad to hear you liked the course so far.</markdown>

<markdown>My general sense of lectures is that a lot of time (sometimes half the lecture!) is spent trying to defend the decisions made in the module (like why brownfield, why waterfall and so on). I don't feel it's inherently wrong, especially since the answers to these "why waterfall..." can be insightful beyond just defending your teaching style, but doing so much of it can make it backfire (one thought I had was: "if the decisions made are so good, why are the lectures spending so much time justifying it unlike other mods?") and leaves little time to delve deeper into course content beyond the textbook. 

I don't get why a prelim peer eval is conducted now. Most teams will have only met twice, maybe even only once, and only had one interaction w/ their other group in their tutorial. There's simply not enough info to share, especially for the other group in the tut. If the teaching team wanted to know if there's any potential issues to get a paper trail, a simple comments box instead of the long form would suffice.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>It is true that some students trust the teaching team to have structured the course well and wouldn't want to spend time learning the rationale behind the course structure. But this is not the case for _all_ students. Some naturally resist going through something that seems more complex/difficult than necessary, and once a student can get into such a resistive mindset, it can get in the way of learning. Hence, we take extra effort to explain the WHY part of the course at the start, so that there is a chance they'll understand and be more accepting of the complications/difficulties they encounter in the course.



Yes, for most CS2103 students the prelim peer evaluation seems less meaningful but keep in mind our main goal of that is to get you to become aware of how you will be peer-evaluated later on (i.e., questions used, and the tool used). For example, knowing that peers will estimatae their contribution to the project later can motivate students to do their share of the work. If the prelim peer evaluation also manages to channel some useful feedback among team members at the same time, we can consider it a side benefit. That said, keep in mind that the majority of the class are in CS2103T and would have met many more times with their team members by the time they do the prelim peer evaluation (because on CS2101 side, students work in the same team).</markdown>

<markdown>Technically not CS2103T but as CS2101 is a co-requisite, my biggest complaint is the total combined workload.
Taking both courses together makes the workload feel very hellish (I feel like I'm in week 12 during week 2-3)</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Yes, twinning can feel like a heavy workload, but keep in mind the workload is 8 Units. It is true that CS2103T is heavy, but CS2101 is not meant to be lighter to make up for it, as it is a 4 Units course in its own right. In theory, some reduction of workload is still expected from this twinning because you are in the same team in both courses (less communication overhead), and you get to reuse some deliverables for both sides i.e., if you had to take the two courses in two semesters or if they are not twinned, the total workload would be higher.</markdown>
