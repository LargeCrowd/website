Good to see that most of you prefer the current mode.<br>
One advantage of live lectures (F2F or online) is that
 you can ask questions immediately if something is unclear.<br>
==On-the-spot Q&A doesn't scale up to very large classes==, unfortunately --
 even if your question is relevant to half the class, it becomes a disruption to
 hundreds of other students, especially so for a course like ours
 in which the students' learning speed can vary a lot.<br>
Hence, our live lectures are limited to briefings only, while most content are delivered as text and
 pre-recorded lectures which students can consume at their own pace.<br>
 Nevertheless, ==you can attend lectures F2F if you wish==, as we have now moved to hybrid mode lectures,
 although we are unlikely to support mid-lecture interactions due to the reason given above.
 While the lecturer can still answer some questions at the end of the lecture, the rest needs to be asynchronous
 e.g., via email or the forum.<br>
 On the positive side, we follow multiple topic threads every week, which means you can continue learning other topic
 threads while waiting for an answer you raised asynchronously. Also, the topics are not that deep/complex
 -- the chance of getting stuck is lower.<br>
 So, I hope you guys are able to manage even if we don't do live lectures covering all content.<br>

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


==Unlike most courses that use lectures as the _primary_ mechanism for delivering course content, our lecture briefings
 serve as a _complementary_ 'top up'==, covering additional examples, motivations behind the topics, commentary on
 how to shape your attitudes related to the subject, anecdotes, etc.
Hence, you can skip lecture briefings (or simply speed-watch the recording later) if you
 are short of time or if you think they are not useful to you.
 Even the in-lecture quiz questions are 'optional' in the sense they are unlikely to make a
 difference in your final participation marks.<br>
 :fas-exclamation: Note: Totally ignoring the lecture briefings will exclude you from future CS2103/T tutor positions
 though, as I do not want to employ as a tutor someone who hasn't received the _full view_ of the course
 (I often talk about the goals/rationales of the course during lecture briefings
 -- not examinable but important nevertheless, especially for a future tutor).

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


Although the majority is OK with online tutorials, we have now moved to F2F mode, to comply with NUS
policy. Although online tutorials seem like a more 'efficient' mode (e.g., no need for travel), I expect physically
meeting with team members often will have some intangible benefits for you in the long run.<br>
We still use Zoom out of necessity (e.g., to share slides, to collect answers), and to get the best of
 both modes (e.g., to have a recording of the tutorial).<br>
Based on the experience so far, there are some areas to improve (e.g., interference caused by parallel tutorials)
 and we'll try to address them in the coming weeks, as best as we can.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


Admittedly, our tutorials can feel slow, less efficient, or less active. For students who otherwise
  prepare well for the tutorials and actively take part in tutorial discussions, this is indeed the case.
  I hope you still bear with us because ==the tutorial structure (like many other things in this course)
  is intended to _raise the lower bar of the whole class_, which is important when there is a major team project
  (to reduce the skill gap between team members)==.
  * **We start with a 10-minute warm up** to give everyone at least a chance to familiarize with the tutorial tasks
    even if they haven't had time to look at them earlier (we don't want them to be left out entirely).
  * **By requiring _everyone_ to respond via private messages**, we aim to get everyone to _think_ about the topic
    at hand and attempt to answer without being biased by others’ answers.
    As I mentioned in a previous lecture, pedagogy research has shown that this act of thinking/attempting
    before receiving the correct answer increases the effectiveness of learning,
    even if you get the answer wrong at first.<br>
    That said, we do want to have some verbal discussions to happen too. That's why we ask you to do the follow up
    discussions verbally.
  * **We monitor tutorial participation** because tutorials are used for ensuring that you all have achieved the desired
    learning targets for the week. If not, slower students tend to neglect the theory part
    (in a misguided attempt to save time) and try to brute-force the project work, which wastes even more time,
    and also exacerbates the skill-gap problems in their teams.
  * So, while the number of questions we go through in each tutorial is fewer and the questions are simpler,
    _getting everyone to answer almost every question on the spot_ (this is different from answering a quiz _at your own
    convenience_, which we already do anyway) has ==a higher total learning gain for the entire class==.<br>
    So, if you are one of the
    stronger students getting less out of our tutorials than you are used to get from other courses, I hope
    you'll be generous and take a 'hit' here to allow your classmates to level up. You might even benefit yourself
    from their levelled-up contributions when you work with them in the team project.

The feedback for the course website is generally positive but there are still _some_ areas to improve further.
  Thanks for your feedback on those. I will continue to try and improve the website whenever I can.<br>
  In the meantime, I thank you for your patience with the website -- it's not easy to disseminate that much
  of information in a way that fits everyone's expectations %%(e.g., some prefer more content to be more 'visual'
  while others prefer minimalistic presentation)%%,
  and we realize that ==it is not easy for you to consume that much of information== either.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


The most common concern about this course is the workload.
  I’m afraid it is not going to get any lower in the second half :-(.
  Some suggestions:
  * If you struggled with the iP workload, don’t be too ambitious with the tP.
    In particular, choose the ‘evolve’ option rather than ‘morph’ option (it’s still not too late to change).
    If you choose the ‘morph’ option, don’t plan to morph it too far away from AB3.<br>
    Reminder: there are no marks allocated for marking the product interesting, unique, cool, etc.<br>
    Also, keep in mind that it is the quality that will count more than the quantity.
    In most cases the quantity is graded on an S/U basis (refer to the tP briefing that we did just before
    the recess break for more info).
    Aim to do less but do it really well.
  * If you don't have time to study all topics, use the
    [topic levels system](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/website/admin/courseExpectations.html#topic-levels)
    to figure out which topics are higher priority.
  * That said, we know the workload concern is real, and we firmly believe that no course should take more than
    its fair share of students' time. On the other hand, this course aims to teach you SE skills that take a lot
    of practice (hence the high workload).<br>
    We've managed to reduce the workload of this course quite bit over the past semesters, and we'll continue to
    do so when we find ways to do that without compromising our learning outcomes.

The pace itself seems to be less of a problem compared to the workload.<br>
Don't worry if you feel like the course is moving too fast; thanks to the iterative approach we use for covering topics,
 you'll get multiple chances to solidify your familiarity of a topic/tool.

<markdown>Whilst I understand that it is an attempt to simulate how a project would progress in the industry, I feel that it would be better to first have the students to do clean code and explain how the code would develop. I feel that I spend too much time on refactoring or redoing my code just to fit the new requirements, or not being able to find a spot to place the new requirements that are not optional.

I am grateful however, that this course is a little more flexible (i.e. week 5 can still be working on week 3 items), since CS2109's first few weeks is very code intensive, I found it very difficult to balance between refactoring and redoing code, and answering CS2109 problem sets.

I am not very sure what is the point of the physical lecture right now, but perhaps it is because I came from a polytechnic background, and I know roughly what to expect from the industry and working with people. </markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>I suspect the 'clean code' approach you are referring to is what one would do in the waterfall SDLC i.e., come up with a design for the full product upfront, rather than evolving the design organically over time (as we are doing now). For students who don't have prior programming experience however, it is not realistic to come up with such a design upfront. Our hope is that all those refactoring difficulties that you face along the way will result in 'lessons learned' that will eventually make you better prepared to come up with such a clean design upfront.

Glad to hear you are coping well with doing both CS2109S and CS2103/T at the same time.

Physical lectures are optional: they are for those who like to sit together with others and get the 'lecture thetre' experience :-) </markdown>

<markdown>The website is very detailed and I highly appreciate the effort. Seriously, in terms of quality of content, I would say this course is one of the best in NUS CS.



However, I would like to suggest less "nesting" for the website. It is not uncommon to have to open drop-down menus 3-4 levels deep. It quickly becomes confusing which layer I am currently on. While I appreciate the effort, it may counter-intuitively make the website harder to comprehend.

<markdown>1. I don't like the course website, it's hard for a student to keep track of which are the parts that the student has already done reading, I don't like to navigate here and there. (I would rather have a pdf version of it so that students can annotate and take note on them)

2. I hate watching pre-recorded lecture, then suddenly I have to context switch to reading, then context switch to watching, and repeat. As you may have already known, switching between reading and watching videos modes are "expensive" for human (just like context switch in operating systems)

3. The project task can cause serious workload cascading. If one didn't manage to follow the requirement for a particular week, he/she may be very difficult to follow the subsequent week's deliverables as they are built upon previous week's result. So, I suggest instead of making the deadline weekly, we make them biweekly.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>1. Yes, we realize the current approach may not fit some. See [my comment on 'Course website'](#Q7).

2. Pre-recorded lectures are complementary. You may skip them if they are not helping you.

3. Not sure if you mean twice a week or every two weeks. In any case, for most deadlines we allow you to catch up even after the deadline is over, without penalty. So, it is up to you to treat them as biweekly if you want. Just ensure you don't fall too far behind, which is the main purpose of our deadlines (i.e., a mechanism for you to self-monitor your progress).</markdown>

<markdown>I really enjoy the course and what it teaches, I just feel that it is very overwhelming at times. It'll be great if some weeks are just there to let us catch up/add additional features if we're free and interested to do so. I think that if I could afford to put more time into the course and feel constant stress, it'll be a lot more enjoyable. Currently, having to redo code in an iterative sense is giving a lot of anxiety because there seems to be so many other things to wrap my mind around and keep track of. I just think that if this course was given more MCs, or was given more time (2 semesters) it'll be a very wonderful learning experience.</markdown>

<markdown>I am enjoying this course a lot. Regarding the workload, I find that the pacing is done well - much of the work is in the first 2 weeks, while other courses don't have that much assignments yet. After week 3 - 4, increments to our codebase slows down slows down significantly as our other courses have more submissions due. I think it is quite fair and I have enjoyed working on my IP so far.

I appreciate the effort taken to constantly update us through the course website and dashboards, personalised emails and other channels of our progress in the course. I find it is very encouraging to receive such constant feedback about what is done well or could be done better.</markdown>

<markdown>I do not think the course website is optimized for phone viewing. Contents are usually cut off when viewed on my phone. Also, for videos with quiz attached on phone browser (safari), after completing the quiz, when the continue button is clicked to close the quiz page and back to the video, the quiz tab reopens again (have to find some creative way to close it instead of the continue button if not it is an endless cycle of closing and reopening).

Other than that, I appreciate that the profs are working towards bettering the welfare of the students. They are also passionate in what they do and teach, it is obviously manifested in the lectures, website, etc. Good job! I am enjoying this course a lot because of it.</markdown>

The issue with the in-video quizzes, I'm afraid it's beyond our control, as it's a third-party tool (called Panopto) used by NUS.

<markdown>I think it would be more manageable if the theory covered every week is less heavy. There is a lot to read on the website. Also, the quiz on Canvas covers questions that aren't covered during lecture and on the website, and the internet does not give a definite answer to those questions. Would be better if the questions are covered in class or the website itself.

But I think the course is great and the classes are well executed, thank you!</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Yes, the amount of theory coverd weekly tend to be on the high side, as we try to cover topics early so that you have more time to apply them in the project (it's like trying to cover 13 weeks of theory in about 10 weeks).

Post-lecture quizzes aren't supposed to have questions not covered in the topics of that week. If you encounter any, please let us know.

<box type="info" header="++My general responses for points raised multiple times++"
 icon=":fas-comment:" icon-size="2x" light >

Given below are some general responses to points you guys (and past students) raised multiple times:

* **JavaFX** (and the tech stack) While JavaFX is the de-facto UI technology for Java desktop apps,
  the chances of you using it in future is low, given most Java work tend to be back-end/server-side.
  Hence, it's fine if you are not very comfortable with JavaFX -- the tP/iP can be done without an in-depth
  knowledge of it.<br>
  At the same time, it is good to get _some_ exposure to a GUI framework too.
  While JavaFX is not the best GUI framework, it has some similarities with other GUI frameworks
  (e.g, use of CSS for styling) and knowing it might help you if you had to use one such GUI framework in future.
* **Audio too soft in pre-recorded videos**: Those videos were recorded in PowerPoint first and then converted to
  videos. It turns out that when converting slides to videos,
  PowerPoint fades out the audio during slide transitions, which is why the audio is
  sometimes too soft. Unfortunately, we noticed this too late. The remedy is to re-record the affected videos,
  which is going to require a substantial effort. We are hoping to do that in a future semester.
* **iP workload is too high around week 3-4**: It is true that some increments in week 3 and 4 causes a peak
  of workload during that period. However, increments causing that (e.g., A-Gradle, Level-10) need to be done
  around that time because they are prerequisites for later increments. Also, any peak in workload is better to
  appear around that period i.e., not too early in the semester but not close to the final submission so that
  there is plenty of time for you to catch up should you fall behind during that period.
* **Website structure is not intuitive**: It is understandable that you feel like a website with less 'nesting'
  (i.e., a 'flatter' version) would be easier to use. After all, many other good websites are designed that way.
  But, our website is a 'monster' amount of content with a lot of cross-links, for example, the same content
  becoming relevant at multiple points of the semester. This is mainly a result of the iterative approach we
  follow for the project as well as covering topics. In that sense it is closer to a Java codebase rather than
  a regular website -- imagine trying to read a code base from top to bottom without jumping around!<br>
  At some point in the past, we did an [A/B test](https://hbr.org/2017/06/a-refresher-on-ab-testing#:~:text=What%20Is%20A,100%20years%20old.)
  with a 'flatter' version against a 'nested' version of the website: we made both versions available to students,
  and used Google analytics to track the reader behavior. The results were more even at the start of the semester,
  but more than 95% of the students eventually gravitated towards the nested version by the end of the semester.
  After doing that experiment for two semesters, we decided to get rid of the flat version
  (as it was too much effort to maintain two versions).<br>
  But the fact remains that a small number of students still found
  the flatter version preferable, which shows it's not easy to make this website intuitive for everyone.
  So, apologies to those who find the website structure confusing. We'll keep trying to improve it.
* **Website not mobile-friendly**: Indeed the website is not optimized for mobile browsers.
  It is something we need to improve in future semesters.
