The tP spans ten weeks, and is to be done in _breadth-first iterative_ fashion.

**The first half of the tP will be spent of laying out the foundation for the iterations**, as illustrated below (note that the diagrams above show the relative size of tasks i.e., smaller tasks are shown as shorter bar).

{{ project_gantt_pre(g) }}

{% set tfw = (tp_first_week | int) %}

<div class="indented-level2">

#### {{ badge("Week " + tfw)}} {{ weekly_tp_themes.w3.name }}

* Form teams
* Set weekly meeting times

#### {{ badge("Week " + (tfw + 1))}} {{ weekly_tp_themes.w4.name }}

* Decide on a general direction for the project (i.e., target user profile, and problem addressed)

#### {{ badge("Week " + (tfw + 2))}} {{ weekly_tp_themes.w5.name }}

* Gather requirements in the form of _user stories_.
* Decide which of them will go into the first version.

#### {{ badge("Week " + (tfw + 3))}} {{ weekly_tp_themes.w6.name }}

* Decide how the product will look like at {{ version_first }}.
* Record that product concept in the form of a user guide.

#### {{ badge("Week " + (tfw + 4))}} {{ weekly_tp_themes.w7.name }}

* Ensure development environment is set up.

* Plan the next iteration i.e., decide who will do which parts by when.

<div tags="m--cs2103">

* Do a _practice_ iteration ({{ version_practice }}) to get used to the workflow. In this iteration, only some documents will be updated.
</div>
</div>

The first half of the tP is light because you will be doing the iP in parallel during that time.

**The second half of the tP is divided into three iterations**, each of which is expected to produce a working version of the product by evolving the product delivered in the previous iteration.

{{ project_gantt_iterations(g) }}

<div class="indented-level2">

#### {{ badge("&nbsp;W" + (tfw + 5)+ "&nbsp;")}} {{ badge("&nbsp;W" + (tfw + 6)+ "&nbsp;")}} Iteration 1 → {{ version_first }}

* This is the first proper iteration.
* Aim to deliver an <tooltip content="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</tooltip> version of the product.


#### {{ badge("W" + (tfw + 7))}} {{ badge("W" + (tfw + 8))}} Iteration 2 → {{ version_penultimate }}

<div tags="m--cs2113 m--cs2103 m--tic4002">

* This version will be tested by peers and you will receive the bug reports without any penalty.
* Aim to **deliver all <tooltip content="i.e., all features you plan to deliver in this project at the end of the semester">target features</tooltip>** so that you can get them tested for free.
</div>
<div tags="m--tic4001 m--tic4002">

* Aim to **deliver almost all <tooltip content="i.e., all features you plan to deliver in this project at the end of the semester">target features</tooltip>** because there will be additional documentation work to be done in the next iteration.
</div>


#### {{ badge("W" + (tfw + 9))}} {{ badge("W" + (tfw + 10)) if tic4001 or tic4002 }} Iteration 3 → {{ version_final }}

<div tags="m--cs2103 m--cs2113">

* This iteration is <span class="text-danger">shorter</span> (slightly more than one week).
* ==**Changes to features are {{ "not allowed" if cs2103 else "strongly discouraged" }}** in this iteration.== Use it for bug fixing, code quality improvements, improving the tests, and polishing up documentation only.
</div>
<div tags="m--tic4001">

* Do final fine-tuning to features.
* Add documentation.
</div>
<div tags="m--tic4002">

* Do final fine-tuning to features. Adding new features is strongly discouraged during this last iteration.
* Add documentation.
</div>

</div>

**The final submission** will be at the {{ "end" if course == "TIC4001" else "start" }} of week 13. [Deliverables](tp-deliverables.html) include an executable jar file, a product website (containing both user and developer documentation), a demo video, among other things.

<div class="indented-level2" tags="m--cs2113 m--cs2103 m--tic4002">

#### {{ badge("W13")}} Evaluation

* The final submission is subjected to a intensive peer testing (in a so called [_practical exam_](tp-pe.html#tp-practical-exam-pe)).
* You will get credit for finding bugs in others' deliverables and penalized for bugs found in your deliverables.
