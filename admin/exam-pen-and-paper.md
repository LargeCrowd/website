There is no midterm.

The final exam is done in F2F pen-and-paper mode (not digital), and has two parts:
* Part 1: MCQ questions (1 hour, 30 marks)
* Part 2: Essay questions (1 hour, 30 marks)

Both papers will be given to you at the start, but you need to **answer Part 1 first** (i.e. MCQ paper). It will be **collected 1 hour after the exam start time** (even if you arrived late for the exam). You are free to start part 2 early if you finish Part 1 early.

{{ icon_important_big_red }} **Questions papers are confidential.** You are not allowed to reveal their content to anyone after the exam. All pages of the exam paper are to be returned at the end of the exam.

<box type="success" seamless>

You will be given a practice exam paper at least one week before the final exam.<br>
You can also use past weekly Canvas quizzes to self-test your knowledge (they have been reopened, and set to show the answer immediately).<br>
However, past exam papers will not be made available.

### Final Exam: Part 1 (MCQ)

**Number of questions: 50**

Each MCQ question gives you one or more statement to evaluate.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, the meaning of answer options are<br>
`A`: Agree. If the question has multiple statements, !!agree with all of them!!.<br>
`B`: Disagree. If the question has multiple statements, !!disagree with at least one of them!!<br>

<box>

{{ icon_example }} Here is an example:

>**Q23:** Java can be used to write OOP code.

The answer should be `A`.
</box>
<box>

{{ icon_example }} Here is another example:

>**Q24:** Testing is a QA activity. It is done by testers only.

As the first statement is true but the second is not, the answer should be `B`.
</box>

Some questions have tags (e.g., <span class="badge bg-secondary text-light">OOP</span>, <span class="badge bg-secondary text-light">JAVA</span>). Those **tags provide additional context about the question**.

<box>

{{ icon_example }} In the example below, the tag indicates that the question is about OOP.

>**Q25:** _Objets_ are instances of a _class_. <span class="badge bg-secondary text-light">OOP</span>

</box>
A small number of questions will provide custom options to choose from.

<box>

{{ icon_example }} In the example below, the tag indicates that the question is about OOP.

>**Q26:** The course project was done using the _____ paradigm.<br>
>[A] Procedural&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[B] OOP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [C] Functional

</box>

Note that you have **slightly more than 1 minute for each question**, which means you need to go through the questions fairly quickly.



You will be given OCR forms %%(i.e., bubble sheets)%% to indicate your answers for Part 1.


**The exam paper is open-book**: you may bring any printed or written materials to the exam in hard copy format.
However, given the fast pace required by Part 1, you will not have time left to refer notes during that part of the exam.

{{ icon_tip }} **Mark the OCR form as you go**, rather than planning to transfer your answers to the OCR form near the end. %%Reason: Given there are 100 questions, it will be hard to estimate how much time you need to mass-transfer all answers to OCR forms.%%

{{ icon_tip }} **Write the answer in the exam paper as well** when marking it in the OCR form. %%Reason: It will reduce the chance of missing a question. Furthermore, in case you missed a question, it will help you correct the OCR form quickly.%%

{{ icon_tip }} We have tried to **avoid deliberately misleading/tricky questions**. If a question seems to take a very long time to figure out, you are probably over-thinking it.

Given the fast pace required by the paper, and the need to collect part 1 answer scripts in the middle of the exam, to be fair to all students, **invigilators will not answer queries about the questions in the exam paper part 1** (but _will_ answer queries related to exam administration).
* If you have a doubt/query about a question, or would like to make an assumption about a question, or would like to report a potential error in the exam paper, write down your doubt/query/assumption in the space provided for it at the end of the exam paper.
* Those doubts/queries/assumptions (if justified) will be taken into account when grading.
